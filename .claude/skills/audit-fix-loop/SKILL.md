  Runs the full multi-agent audit workflow, fixes every issue, re-audits until
  Architecture, Correctness risk, and Complexity debt are all grade A, then
  commits via git-commit. Use ONLY when the user explicitly invokes

# Audit–Fix Loop

## Purpose

**Audit → fix everything → audit again** in a loop until the **`audit`** rubric
shows **A** for **Architecture**, **Correctness risk**, and **Complexity debt**,
then **one final `git-commit`** for the accumulated fixes.

## Use When

- The user **explicitly** invokes **`audit-fix-loop`**, **`$audit-fix-loop`**,
  or clearly asks to **use audit-fix-loop** (same intent boundary as
  **`execute-plan-hardcore`** — no implicit routing).

## Do Not Use When

- The user only asked for a **read-only audit** — use **`audit`**.
- The user is **executing a checked-in plan** and wants the hardcore gate after
  plan work — prefer **`execute-plan-hardcore`**.
- A **single phase** needs plan rubric review — use **`phase-audit`**.
- Git writes are forbidden and nothing overrides that.

## Authority Model

Explicit invocation of **`audit-fix-loop`** authorizes:

- Running the full **`audit`** procedure **as part of this skill** even if the
  current message does **not** contain the substring **`audit`** — this skill is
  the explicit request for **audit and implementation fixes** until grades reach
  **A** (overrides **`audit`**'s default "surface only unless asked" rule for
  this workflow only).
- **Multiple** audit cycles with **multi-agent** depth per **`audit`** (parallel
  readonly charters when the harness supports it; sequential charters when not).
- **`git-commit`** once **after** **A / A / A** is achieved, following
  **`git-commit`** staging and message rules (whole-tree default unless the user
  narrows scope).

If **`audit-fix-loop`** was only inferred from vague wording — **stop** before
fixes or commit and confirm intent. This mirrors the exception clause in
[CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md).

## Procedure

1. **Establish scope** once (whole repo, paths, diff, or feature) — same table
   as **`audit`**. State it in each audit report header.

2. **Audit pass (read + grade):** Follow **`audit`** end-to-end:
   - **Mechanical signals** from repo root, aligned with **`audit`** for this
     repo: the **CTC sanity train**
     (`PYTHONPATH="$PWD" PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1 python3 train_CTC.py --epochs 1 --sanity`)
     plus the surface-specific checks the scope touches. **`pytest`** only if
     test files exist. **Lint:** none configured — say so.
   - Delegate **multiple readonly** charters when depth warrants it (**when in
     doubt, parallelize** per **`audit`**).
   - Merge, dedupe, assign **P0–P3** severities, and **Architecture** /
     **Correctness risk** / **Complexity debt** grades (**A–F**).

3. **Pass condition:** all three grades are **A**. If mechanical checks fail,
   treat failures as **P0** and fix before accepting any **A**.

4. **If any grade is below A:** fix **all** issues that block **A** (prioritize
   **P0**/**P1** and mechanical failures). Re-run targeted checks; iterate code
   until ready for a fresh audit.

5. **Loop:** Return to step **2** with a **full** audit pass (not only a
   spot-check) until **A / A / A**. Re-scope if the diff or risk surface grew.

6. **Stuck loop:** After complete cycles, if **A / A / A** is blocked by a
   product or architecture tradeoff, **stop**, report grades and the blocker,
   and **ask the user** — do not spin forever.

7. **Final commit:** When step **5** passes, run **`git-commit`** once for all
   changes produced by the loop (subject/body per **`git-commit`**; whole-tree
   staging unless the user specified otherwise).

## Expect the no-tests finding

With zero automated tests, **Correctness risk** rarely earns an honest **A** on
a wide scope. Two legitimate outcomes:

- **Narrow the scope** so correctness can be argued from reading the code plus
  a run of the relevant sanity train and benchmark.
- **Add tests as part of the fix loop** — that is a real fix, and it converts
  `python3 -m pytest` into a genuine gate for every later run.

What is **not** legitimate: grading Correctness **A** because nothing failed
when nothing ran.

## Boundaries

- Do **not** grade-inflate; the **`audit`** rubric applies.
- Do **not** lower thresholds to reach **A** — raise quality.
- Do **not** claim a check passed that you did not run.
- **`git-commit`** runs **after** grades are **A / A / A**, not after the first
  audit pass unless the first pass already meets **A** (still follow
  **`git-commit`** for recording).

## Relation to Other Skills

- **`audit`:** Defines the audit procedure, charters, mechanical checks, and
  grading; **`audit-fix-loop`** adds **mandatory fix iterations** and a **final
  commit**.
- **`execute-plan-hardcore`:** Plan execution **plus** audit-to-**A** gate;
  **`audit-fix-loop`** is **only** the audit–fix–commit loop (no plan phases).
- **`git-commit`:** Final step; post-commit behavior in **`git-commit`** is
  **not** a substitute for step **2** above.
