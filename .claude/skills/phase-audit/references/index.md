# Phase Audit References

Canonical docs for `phase-audit` live under **`README/Skills/`**:

- `README/Skills/plan-workflow-skills-guide.md`
  Read first for the shared workflow contract and the boundary between
  `phase-audit` and `execute-plan`.
- `README/Skills/phase-audit-rubric.md`
  Read for the canonical review checklist and commit-readiness criteria.
- `README/Templates/Plans-template.md`
  Read when you need to validate whether the active plan phase, checkbox
  updates, and verification text still match the template contract.

Always inspect:

- the active plan file and the specific phase being audited
- the changed files for that phase
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `requirements-ci.txt` when judging CI readiness
  — CI is CPU-only Linux with torch + numpy only
- any directly linked `README/Guides/...`, `docs/...`, or `README/Skills/...`
  files that constrain the implementation
